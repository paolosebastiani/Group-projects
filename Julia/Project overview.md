# Introduction
In this project, we created and used an ARX model to forecast some macroeconomic variables, and at the end we calculated the "Mean Squared Forecast Error".
In particular, we worked with this [FRED dataset](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/) (2024-03) and, after performing some data manipulation, made predictions for 3 future periods for the variables "industrial production", "consumer price index" and "Fed funds rate".
