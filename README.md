# Group-projects
In this repository, you will find the group projects completed during my MSc in Economics and Finance.
These projects were undertaken as part of courses such as 'Python Laboratory,' 'Computational Tools for Macro-Econometrics,' and 'Advanced Macroeconomics.'
For the sake of clarity, I decided to create a folder for each language used.
